# GUI User Guide Integration - Update

## 📖 What Was Added

Added comprehensive user guides and help system directly into the Nesca v2r GUI interface to help non-professional users understand and use the application effectively.

## 🎯 Key Features Added

### 1. Welcome Banner
A prominent information banner at the top of the configuration tab that welcomes new users:
> 💡 **New to scanning?** Hover over any field for detailed help

**Purpose:** Immediately informs users that help is available.

### 2. Enhanced Tooltips
Every field now has detailed, HTML-formatted tooltips with:

- **Clear explanations** of what each setting does
- **Examples** showing proper usage
- **Recommendations** for different scenarios
- **Categories** and structured information

#### Tooltip Examples:

**Scan Mode:**
```
How do I choose the scan mode?
• IP Range: Scan a range of IP addresses (e.g., 192.168.1.0/24)
• DNS Scan: Scan a domain name or hostname
• Import from File: Load IPs from a text file
```

**Target Field:**
```
Examples for Target field:
CIDR notation:
• 192.168.1.0/24 (scans 192.168.1.1-254)
• 10.0.0.0/16 (scans 10.0.x.x - 65536 hosts)

Range notation:
• 192.168.1.1-192.168.1.100
• 192.168.1.1-254

Single IP: 192.168.1.1
DNS: example.com
File: /path/to/ips.txt (one IP per line)
```

**Ports:**
```
Common ports to scan:
Web: 80 (HTTP), 443 (HTTPS), 8080, 8000, 8443
Streaming: 554 (RTSP), 1935 (RTMP), 9000
Cameras: 37777, 34567, 8000, 88
Other: 21 (FTP), 22 (SSH), 23 (Telnet), 3389 (RDP)

Format: Separate with commas (80,443,8080)
Or use ranges: 80-100 or 8000-8100
```

### 3. Inline Help Text
Every major field now has a small help label below it:

**Examples:**
- "ℹ️ Choose how you want to specify targets"
- "ℹ️ Use CIDR (/24) or range (192.168.1.1-255) notation"
- "ℹ️ Separate ports with commas. Default: common web & camera ports"
- "ℹ️ More threads = faster scan. Recommended: 100"
- "ℹ️ Results will be saved in your chosen format"

**Purpose:** Quick, at-a-glance reminders without needing to hover.

### 4. Results Tab Guide
Added an informational banner on the Results tab:
> 📋 **Results Table:** Double-click any row to view detailed information | **Export:** Save results to JSON/CSV | **Clear:** Remove all results

**Purpose:** Explain how to interact with the results table.

### 5. Professional Tooltips
Advanced options also have detailed tooltips:

**Adaptive Scan:**
```
Adaptive Scanning:
Automatically adjust thread count based on network performance.

How it works:
• Starts with your set thread count
• Monitors network latency and errors
• Increases threads if network is stable
• Decreases if too many timeouts occur

Best for: Large scans on varying network conditions
```

**Smart Scan:**
```
Smart Scanning:
Prioritize common ports to scan faster.

How it works:
• First scans most likely ports (80, 443, etc.)
• After finding open ports, focuses on their protocols
• Skips unlikely combinations

Effect: Faster results, fewer false positives
Good for: Quick reconnaissance
```
