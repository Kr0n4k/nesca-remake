## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration Tab - Detailed Guide

### Welcome Banner
At the top, you'll see a helpful banner that says:
> üí° **New to scanning?** Hover over any field for detailed help

This banner reminds you that tooltips are available for every field.

### Scan Mode

**What it does:** Choose how you want to specify your targets.

**Options:**
- **IP Range**: Scan a range of IP addresses
  - Example: `192.168.1.0/24`
  - Best for: Local network scanning
  
- **DNS Scan**: Scan a domain name
  - Example: `example.com`
  - Best for: Web server scanning
  
- **Import from File**: Load IPs from a text file
  - Format: One IP per line
  - Best for: Bulk scanning

**Tooltip help:** Hover to see what each mode does and when to use it.

### Target Field

**What it does:** Enter your scan target.

**Example formats:**

**CIDR notation** (most common):
- `192.168.1.0/24` ‚Üí Scans 192.168.1.1-254
- `10.0.0.0/16` ‚Üí Scans 10.0.x.x (65,536 hosts)

**Range notation:**
- `192.168.1.1-192.168.1.100` ‚Üí Scans first 100 hosts
- `192.168.1.1-254` ‚Üí All hosts in subnet

**Single IP:**
- `192.168.1.1` ‚Üí Just one host

**DNS:**
- `example.com` ‚Üí Domain name

**File:**
- `/path/to/ips.txt` ‚Üí Import from file

**Tooltip help:** Hover to see all formatting examples and explanations.

### Ports Field

**What it does:** Specify which ports to scan.

**Common port categories:**

**Web Servers:**
- `80` - HTTP
- `443` - HTTPS
- `8080` - HTTP Alternative
- `8000` - HTTP Alternative
- `8443` - HTTPS Alternative

**Media/Streaming:**
- `554` - RTSP (cameras)
- `1935` - RTMP
- `9000` - Streaming

**Cameras:**
- `37777` - RVI/Hikvision
- `34567` - Some cameras
- `8000` - Some cameras
- `88` - Some cameras

**Other Services:**
- `21` - FTP
- `22` - SSH
- `23` - Telnet
- `3389` - RDP
- `3306` - MySQL

**Format:** Separate with commas
- Example: `80,443,8080`
- Or use ranges: `80-100` or `8000-8100`

**Default:** Pre-filled with common web and camera ports

**Tooltip help:** Hover to see categorized port list.

### Threads

**What it does:** Controls how many parallel connections happen at once.

**Understanding threads:**
- More threads = faster scanning
- But also uses more CPU and network

**Recommended values:**
- **50-100**: Safe, normal usage (100 is default)
- **100-200**: Faster, for stable networks
- **200+**: Very fast, only for very stable networks

**Tooltip help:** Hover to see detailed recommendations based on your network.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Advanced Options

Expand the Advanced Options group to see more settings.

#### Timeout

**What it does:** How long to wait for a response before giving up.

**Understanding timeouts:**
- Too low = missed hosts (false negatives)
- Too high = slow scanning

**Recommended:**
- **1000-3000ms**: Fast networks (default: 3000ms)
- **5000ms**: Slower/remote networks
- **10000ms+**: Very slow or unreliable networks

**Tooltip help:** Hover to understand how to choose the right timeout.

#### Verify SSL Certificates

**What it does:** Check if SSL certificates are valid.

**Options:**
- **Checked**: Only accept valid certificates (more secure)
- **Unchecked**: Accept any certificate, even self-signed

**When to uncheck:**
- Scanning IoT devices
- Scanning cameras
- Scanning devices with self-signed certificates
- Testing environments

**Tooltip help:** Hover to see when to use each option.

#### Adaptive Scan

**What it does:** Automatically adjusts thread count based on network performance.

**How it works:**
1. Starts with your set thread count
2. Monitors network latency and errors
3. Increases threads if network is stable
4. Decreases if too many timeouts occur

**Best for:** Large scans on varying network conditions

**Tooltip help:** Hover to see detailed explanation of the algorithm.

#### Smart Scan

**What it does:** Prioritizes common ports for faster results.

**How it works:**
1. First scans most likely ports (80, 443, etc.)
2. After finding open ports, focuses on their protocols
3. Skips unlikely combinations

**Effect:**
- Faster results
- Fewer false positives

**Best for:** Quick reconnaissance

**Tooltip help:** Hover to understand the optimization strategy.

### üìä Export Options

#### Export Format

**What it does:** Choose how results are saved.

**Options:**
- **JSON**: Structured data format, easy for scripts
  - Best for: Developers, automation
  
- **CSV**: Spreadsheet format
  - Best for: Excel, Google Sheets, general users
  
- **Both**: Save in both formats
  - Best for: Maximum flexibility

**Tooltip help:** Hover to see recommendations.

4. **Adjust threads:** If you see many timeouts, reduce threads

5. **Use adaptive mode:** For large scans on unpredictable networks

6. **Smart scan:** Use for quick checks, disable for comprehensive scans

7. **Export regularly:** Save results as you go

8. **Clear between scans:** Start fresh for each target

---

## üÜò Troubleshooting

**No results found:**
